uCAN Library for Arduino
==============
This library is compatible with any shield or CAN interface that uses the MCP2515 CAN protocol controller.

This library assumes /CS is connected to Arduino pin 10 (SS).

This library depends on the (included) Seeedstudio CAN_BUS_Shield library for underlying CAN functionality.

Installation
==============
Copy this into your "[...]/MySketches/libraries/" folder and restart the Arduino editor.
